This profile is aimed to implement:
Blur Detection for Digital Images Using Wavelet Transform, Hanghang Tong, Mingjing Li, Hongjiang Zhang

I used two programming languages, matlab and C++, to implement it.

Using matlab source
    Just execute script start.m

Using C++ source
    My code depends on Opencv, if your computer has Opencv(>=2.4.x), execute command 
        ./compile.sh main.cpp
    on bash shell terminal to generate execute file “main”, and execute command
        ./main [image]
    to run.
